I completed a project for Panneri Store, utilizing 2022 sales data to create an interactive dashboard. This tool visualizes key metrics like revenue, customer demographics, and inventory levels, enabling informed decision-making and enhancing operational efficiency. The dashboard's interactivity facilitates detailed analysis and trend identification.


▶ Some of the insights:
- Maximum sales in 2022 are in the month of March (~ 1.90M).
- maximum number of customers are women (~64%) i.e. women are more likely to buy compared to men.
- Maximum sales have come from Maharashtra (~2.99M) and minimum sales from Haryana (~0.81M).
- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 states from a sales point of view (~35%).
- majority of orders we have received throughout the year have been delivered (~92%).
- Our customers are mostly adult women (~34.59%) and men (~15.47%), who fall into the age group of (30-49 yrs).
- Maximum sales are from Amazon among all other channels (~35%).
- The top 3 are Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra: max contributing (~80%).

▶ Conclusion:
- To improve Panneri Indian Store sales, I would recommend targeting women customers of age group (30-49 yrs : adult) living in Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers, and discount coupons available on Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra.
